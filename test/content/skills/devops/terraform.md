# Terraform

Terraform is the leading IaC (Infrastucture as Code) tool and is one of the core components of the DevOps tooling. Due to licencing changes, there is now a community fork called OpenTofu. There is also Terragrunt which improves reusability between Terraform environments.

I have several years of experience using Terraform and Terragrunt for managing cloud resources in both professional and personal settings. I have used Terraform in various settings:

- Managing all major AWS resources, IAM policies
- Managing Cloudflare DNS, Access and Tunnel resources
- Orchestrating Datadog synthetics and API checks
- Provisioning of all Homelab virtual machines
- Production of Butane/Ignition JSON manifests for Flatcar Linux VM installs
- Orchestrating Docker Swarm services in the Homelab
