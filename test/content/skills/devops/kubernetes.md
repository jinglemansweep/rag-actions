# Kubernetes

Kubernetes and its entire ecosystem including OpenShift, Talos, K32 and MicroK8S.

I have been happily using Kubernetes in both professional and personal capacities.

- Creating and maintaining a suite of Helm charts
- Developing a reverse proxy that reacts to Kubernetes events
- Experience of many popular operators such as External Secrets, Cert Manager and MetalLB
