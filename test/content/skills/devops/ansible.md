# Ansible

Ansible is the defacto provisioning tool in the DevOps space. It enables the provisioning and configuration of many operating systems including Linux, MacOS and Windows.

I have several years of experience using Ansible in both professional and personal settings. I have used Ansible in various settings:

- Provisioning and updating corporate development lab virtual machines
- Automatic management of Homelab virtual machines and network appliances
